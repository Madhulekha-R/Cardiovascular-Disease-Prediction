### About the Project

The Cardiovascular disease remains a pervasive global health challenge, with significant implications for mortality rates and healthcare systems worldwide. Despite advancements in medical technology and treatment protocols, variability in healthcare professionals' expertise often leads to suboptimal diagnosis and treatment decisions, contributing to adverse patient outcomes. To address this issue, predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms presents a promising avenue for improving heart disease diagnosis and management. Thus, the project **Cardiovascular Disease Prediction** aims to evaluate the performance of machine learning models in predicting heart disease, leveraging a diverse set of health parameters and data mining techniques. The project focuses on assessing the models' accuracy and generalization ability through comprehensive evaluation on both training and test datasets. By analyzing the models' performance metrics and detecting potential overfitting, the research seeks to identify the most effective predictive model for heart disease diagnosis.
